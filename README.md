# Dobre zna≈• !

Parody of the TV quiz show "Dobre Vediet". My Java FX side project for the summer camp. 

This is the side project I worked on during summer of 2017. Every summer I go to kid's camp as volunteer. This year we recreated Quiz show "Dobre vediet", made funny videos as content and hosted an evening show using this app. 

## Graphical interface
I designed the App interface to be similar to the original TV show. 

### Themes screen

I listed every theme, for which we prepared single question. In the bottom we can see the player which is actually on the move. Theme that was successfully completed is green and the unsuccessful one is grey. You can only choose from yellow ones, which are available.

### Question screen

For every theme there was displayed full question. There is also a brief further description of the question. User can choose from 3 answers and confirm final decision.

### Score review screen

After choosing answer app shows the actual score of the both teams. Next team is on the move and they again choose from available themes and questions.
